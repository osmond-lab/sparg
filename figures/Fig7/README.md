# Figure 7

Instructions for recreating:

1) Create the dataset by running `TwoPopsTwoDims.slim`. This will output the tree sequence file `rep1_S025_I1_R2_W100_D2.trees`.
2) Open `Fig7.ipynb` in Jupyter Lab to draw the plots shown in Figure 7 of the manuscript.

The `ancestral_locations.csv` file contains the true and estiamted locations using various windows. This is output at the end of `Fig7.ipynb` and can be used to recreate the figure without rerunning everything from the beginning, though this is a quick process.
