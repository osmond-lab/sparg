Instructions for recreating:

1) The .trees files used in the code below were generated using `UnboundedSpace_SingleTree.slim` SLiM file. The value of SIGMA_disp was changed manually to values 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 1.75 and the SLiM file rerun.
2) Open `Plot.ipynb` in Jupyter Lab to draw the plots shown in Supplementary Figures S5 of the manuscript.
