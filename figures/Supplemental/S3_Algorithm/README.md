# Figure S3 - Algorithm

For efficiency purposes, we divided the benchmarking into many different runs. This is not absolutely necessary and `benchmark.py` alone could be used. The following instructions include this division of labor:

Instructions for recreating:

1) All benchmark results can be found in `DataFiles/`. Exact benchmark results will be system dependent, but overall patterns should hold.
2) Open `Plot_time.ipynb` in Jupyter Lab to draw the plots shown in Figure S3 of the manuscript.This also contains the detailed instructions to generate the files in `DataFiles/`
